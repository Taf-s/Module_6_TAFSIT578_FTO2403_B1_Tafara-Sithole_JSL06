# [JSL06] Submission: CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge

This is the readme file for the CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge

## Description

The purpose of the project was to create and use functions to dynamically populate the menu items on the page and to implement a callback function to handle adding items to the order.

## Design Choices and Functionality

I used the array destructuring to extract the menu array's category and items, to assign them to a variable which allowed me to dynamically add and create elements to be displayed on the menu.
I then iterated over the destructured array using a for loop in combination with the Object.entries method to get the key and value pairs of the menu array.
Lastly, I created a callback function for adding items to the order as well as a remove from order function for better user experience, incase a user changes their mind or adds too many items to their order.

## Technologies Used

\*Javascript for functionality.
